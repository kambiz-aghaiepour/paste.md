# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-14)

**Core value:** Users can quickly paste Markdown content and get a shareable link that renders it beautifully -- zero friction from paste to share.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — foundation-data-path

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (foundation-data-path) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 2
Status: Phase complete — ready for verification
Last activity: 2026-05-14

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 5min
- Total execution time: 0.08 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 1 | 5min | 5min |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (5min)
- Trend: N/A (first plan)

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 01 P02 | 2min | 2 tasks | 3 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Next.js 16 + App Router stack per research recommendation (Server Components for paste views, client-side for editor preview)
- [Roadmap]: SQLite via better-sqlite3 + Drizzle ORM for zero-ops storage
- [Roadmap]: react-markdown + remark-gfm + rehype-sanitize + Shiki for rendering pipeline
- [Roadmap]: Schema includes expires_at from day one to prevent retrofitting
- [01-01]: Used manual scaffold instead of create-next-app (existing files conflict)
- [01-01]: WAL mode set at runtime in DB singleton, not during drizzle-kit push
- [01-01]: Route Handlers for paste creation (not Server Actions) per D-08 API spec
- [Phase ?]: Direct handler testing pattern: import and call route handlers with constructed Request objects

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research gap]: Hybrid rendering path (SSR for paste views, CSR for editor preview) needs validation during Phase 2 planning
- [Research gap]: Shiki client-side bundle size for live preview -- may need lighter alternative (highlight.js) for editor
- [Research gap]: SQLite WAL mode in Docker with mounted volumes needs validation during Phase 1
